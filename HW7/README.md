# Homework 7 - Katayoun Borojerdi

### Overview
The objective of this homework is simple: modify the processing pipeline that you implemented in homework 3 and replace the OpenCV-based face detector with a Deep Learning-based one. You could, for instance, rely on what you learned in TensorRT lab 5 or Digits lab 5

### Questions

#### Describe your solution in detail. What neural network did you use? What dataset was it trained on? What accuracy does it achieve?

#### Does it achieve reasonable accuracy in your empirical tests? Would you use this solution to develop a robust, production-grade system?

#### What framerate does this method achieve on the Jetson? Where is the bottleneck?

#### Which is a better quality detector: the OpenCV or yours?
