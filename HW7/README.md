# Homework 7 - Katayoun Borojerdi

## Questions

### Describe your solution in detail. What neural network did you use? What dataset was it trained on? What accuracy does it achieve?

### Does it achieve reasonable accuracy in your empirical tests? Would you use this solution to develop a robust, production-grade system?

### What framerate does this method achieve on the Jetson? Where is the bottleneck?

### Which is a better quality detector: the OpenCV or yours?
